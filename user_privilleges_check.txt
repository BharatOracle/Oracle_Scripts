You can use the below script.
SELECT o.OWNER , o.OBJECT_NAME , o.SUBOBJECT_NAME , o.OBJECT_TYPE ,
t.NAME “Tablespace Name”, s.growth/(1024*1024) “Growth in MB”,
(SELECT sum(bytes)/(1024*1024)

FROM DBA_OBJECTS o,
( SELECT TS#,OBJ#,
SUM(SPACE_USED_DELTA) growth

GROUP BY TS#,OBJ#
HAVING SUM(SPACE_USED_DELTA) > 0
ORDER BY 2 DESC ) s,

I am using 12c pluggable DB’s on Exadata with 44 cores (88 cpu’s). I can’t seem to find a convenient method for finding out how much CPU resources are being used using AWR statistics. AWR gives me the load stats as if all of the cores are available, but of course I am using the resource manager so those stats are not reflecting the resource manager settings for the CPU resource.
Please suggest what I need to do.
Thanks-

Hi Admin,first of all i wanna say kudos for the great job put out here,I was
wondering if you guys can come up with something this great in Golden gate.
I have a personal issues,can i please get help with a monitoring script,precisely
setting an alert on table increment…i received the below ticket and i have been working on it
The issue is whenever there is a LOCK in INCREMENT table users will not be able to access the application and we will reach out to DBA team to get the information under which session the increment table got locked and once we receive the information we provide our confirmation to kill the session. Now we are looking to set up an proactive mechanism which will alert us before user reports the issue. Once the issue has been occurred we will expect the alert to provide us the session name and the server name details.
Thanks in Advance Admin
